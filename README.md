The platform allows users to explore, learn about, and purchase smart devices through
online stores managed via the website. Users can choose to buy individual devices and
learn how to assemble them on their own or select kits that come with detailed assembly
instructions and access instructional videos from expert instructors. Additionally, users
can interact with the store through live chat and report issues with devices or kits when
encountering problems. This enables staff to provide timely support and effective
management.

Products from each store must be processed and approved by an Administrator role
before they are allowed to be sold. Accounts designated as Stores must go through a
vetting process before going live. Stores also have the ability to create promotional
blogs, giving users more flexible access to information and content.

A key advantage of the platform is the warranty system, which supports products
damaged during shipping or those with pre-existing defects. Furthermore, users have a
limited number of support interactions with each combo in the store, ensuring efficient
service while preventing abuse of the support system.
